## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Domain model of YAML documents, carrying source ranges.
- Source tree in four layers: `domain`, `application`, `infrastructure` and `adapters`.
- Development toolchain that builds, type-checks, lints, formats and tests the code (esbuild, tsc, ESLint, Prettier and Vitest, respectively), with components written in TSX for Preact.
- Boundaries between layers, enforced by ESLint, which admit the libraries `obsidian` and `preact` in the adapters layer only.
